berkeley - A Berkeley theme for Drupal 7 based on Zen 5.
==============
PURPOSE
-------

The Berkeley theme is a Drupal 7 theme developed by
IST Drupal <ist-drupal@lists.berkeley.edu> at UC Berkeley
for use with websites based on the Berkeley distribution.

It is a Zen 5 (drupal.org/project/zen) sub-theme.

Branches
--------

The drupal.org git strategy is not to use the master branch.  Click on
the github Branches tab to get to the 6.x and 7.x branches. The
READMEs on the branches are a lot more entertaining.
